Predicting the punctuality of shipment
Using the data of an international e-commerce company, predicting whether a shipment will arrive on time depending on features such as type of shipment, weight of the product, product importance, etc. with machine learning approaches.
Using Python, separate the data into train data and test data, change categorical features into numerical data and rescale features with minmax scalar; calculate and visualize the Pearson correlations of data to delete features that are closely correlated and select the top 5 relevant features for prediction.
Predicting with Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbors, and Decision Tree approaches. Further improve the predicting accuracy by doing hyperparameter tuning and evaluate the models with the accuracy score. Identify the model and parameters that promise the highest accuracy score for predicting if a shipment will arrive on time.
